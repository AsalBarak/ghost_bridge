# The code here is a quick, cheap hack to place information about
# visible faces into the cogserver atomspace.  There ae several
# different ways we could implement this:
#
# A) Open a socket to the cogserver, send atoms through the socket.
# B) Run inside the cogserver, and place atoms in the atomspace
#    directly.
#
# At the moment, for convenience, B) is implemented. However, A better
# long term choice might be design A).
