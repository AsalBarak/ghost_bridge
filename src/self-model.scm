; Model of Eva's current physical state, represented in the Atomspace.
;
; This attempts to maintain a model, in the atomspace, of what the robot
; is actually doing, from moment to moment.  This model is important for
; multiple reasons:
;
; -- It is needed for Action Orchestration, to make sure that multiple
;    conflicting command sources do not cause the robot to do incoherent
;    things (such as smile and frown at the same time, or move lips
;    without talking, etc.)
;
; -- It is needed for self-awareness, so that the chatbot can respond to
;    questions about what Eva is doing.
;
; Example usage:
; Load the needed modules.
; (use-modules (opencog) (opencog query) (opencog exec))
; (use-modules (opencog atom-types) (opencog python))
; (use-modules (opencog eva-model))
;;;; start roscore before doing the load below.
; (python-eval "execfile('atomic.py')")
;
; Examples and debugging hints:
; Some (but not all) state queries:
; (cog-evaluate! (DefinedPredicate "chatbot is talking"))
; (cog-evaluate! (DefinedPredicate "chatbot is listening"))
; (cog-evaluate! (DefinedPredicate "chatbot is happy"))
