; behvaior.scm
;
; Configurable robot behavior tree, implemented in Atomese.
;
; Defines a set of behaviors that express Eva's personality. The
; currently-defined behaviors include acknowledging new people who enter
; the room, rotating attention between multiple occupants of the room,
; falling asleep when bored (i.e. the room is empty), and acting
; surprised when someone leaves unexpectedly.
;
; HOWTO:
; ------
; Run the main loop:
;    (behavior-tree-run)
; Pause the main loop:
;    (behavior-tree-halt)
;
; Unit testing:
; -------------
; The various predicates below can be manually unit tested by manually
; adding and removing new visible faces, and then manually invoking the
; various rules. See faces.scm for utilities.
;
; Basic examples:
;    Manually insert a face: (make-new-face id)
;    Remove a face: (remove-face id)
;    Etc.: (show-room-state) (show-interaction-state) (show-visible-faces)
;
; Manually unit test the new-arrival sequence.  You can do this without
; an attached camera; she won't track the face location, but should respond.
;    (make-new-face "42")
;    (cog-evaluate! (DefinedPredicateNode "New arrival sequence"))
;    (show-acked-faces)
;    (show-room-state)
;    (show-interaction-state)
;    (cog-evaluate! (DefinedPredicateNode "Interact with people"))
;
; Unit test the main interaction loop:
;    (run)  ; start the behavior tree running. Should print loop iteration.
;    (make-new-face "42")  ; Should start showing expressions, gestures.
;    (remove-face "42")  ; Should retur to neutral.
;    (halt) ; Pause the loop iteration; (run) will start it again.
;
; Unit test chatbot:
;    (State chat-state chat-start) ; to simulate having it talk.
;    (State chat-state chat-stop)  ; to signal that talking has stopped.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------
; Character engine notes
; The character engine is an older incarnation of this code, predating
; the owyl behavior trees.  The below are notes abouit some of the
; things it did, and where to look for equivalents here.
;
; 1) Room-state transtions
; -- no faces present for a while
;     (cog-evalute! (DefinedPredicateNode "Search for attention"))
; -- no-face just transitioned to one-face
;     (cog-evaluate! (DefinedPredicateNode "Was Empty Sequence"))
; -- no-face just transitioned to multiple-faces
; -- one-face just transitioned to no-face
; -- one-face just transitioned to multiple-faces
;      (DefinedPredicate "Respond to new arrival")
;      (DefinedPredicateNode "Interacting Sequence")
; -- one face present for a while
; -- multiple faces present for a while
; -- multiple-faces just transitioned to one-face
; -- multiple-faces just transitioned to no-face
;
; 2) Interactions depend on whether person is known or not.
;
; -- it's a familiar face
; -- it's a familiar face to whom the robot has already been introduced
; -- it's an unfamiliar face
;
; 3) Familiar-face interactions
;
; -- prior emotions when interacting with that face were positive
; -- prior emotions when interacting with that face were negative
; -- prior emotions when interacting with that face were neutral
;
; 4) Introduction sequence
;    If the robot is talking to someone with whom it has not previously
;    been introduced, it can enter into a short procedure aimed at
;    gathering the person's name...
;
; 5) Adhoc animation patterns
;
; -- changing a subject (maybe the AIML can send a signal indicating
;    when the subject is being changed?)
; -- asking a question of the user
; -- starting to talk after a period of being silent
; -- ending an interaction with one guy before shifting attention to
;    another guy
; -- starting an interaction with a new guy after shifting attention
;    from another guy
;
