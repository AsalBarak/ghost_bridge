Design overview
===============
This is a pre-prototype.  But still:

* The `face_track` directory contains code for visual servoing: it
  receives ROS messages about human face locations from the webcam
  + pi_vision subsystem.  It calls methods in `face_atomic.py` to
  poke face-ids (ID numbers) into the atomspace.

  A new face (for example, faceid 123) is indicated with this message:
  ```
   (EvaluationLink (PredicateNode "visible face")
             (ListLink (NumberNode "123")))
  ```
  See `face_track/README.md` for details.


Running
=======

* At the bash prompt:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/opencog/modules
```
Failure to do this will result in the message:
```
ERROR: In procedure dynamic-link: file: "libguile-cogserver", message: "file not found"
```

* Change directory to your catkin_ws and then run `scripts/eva.sh`.
  This will start up a byobu multiplexed terminal, and will run ROS,
  the ros face tracker, the blender API and the opencog server
  automatically, and will launch most of the needed behavior scripts.


Development shortcuts
=====================
* Start guile in this directory, then from the guile prompt:
```
(use-modules (opencog cogserver))
(start-cogserver "../scripts/opencog.conf")
```
Then load the python code:
```
echo -e "py\n" | cat - atomic.py |netcat localhost 17020
```
Then back at the guile prompt:
```
(load-from-path "faces.scm")
(load-from-path "btree.scm")
```

A different, currently broken/unfinsihed/demo variant:
```
(load-from-path "eva-fsm.scm")
```

Debugging notes
===============

Cython modules are installed here:
```
/usr/local/share/opencog/python/opencog
```

Get to the cogserver prompt like this:
```
rlwrap telnet localhost 17020
```
and then enter the python interpreter by saying `py`, or the scheme
interpreter by saying `scm`.

From the python prompt, the following should list the python
opencog modules:
```
help('opencog')
```

Face tracking debug
===================
Print all visible faces in the atomspace:

```
rlwrap telnet localhost 17020
(cog-incoming-set (PredicateNode "visible face"))
(cog-bind chk-room-empty)
(cog-bind chk-room-non-empty)
(show-room-state)
```

Not that if the room state changes, `(show-room-state)` will show the
wrong state until after both cog-binds ar performed!

```
rostopic pub --once /opencog/glance_at std_msgs/Int32 29
rostopic pub --once /opencog/look_at std_msgs/Int32 29
rostopic pub --once /opencog/gaze_at std_msgs/Int32 29
```


Enhancement TODO List
=====================
A list of changes to the atomspace that could help with this:

* Use TimeNode for time; use the Timeserver as needed
* Create a CurrentTimeNode that returns the current time.  To store
  the current time, one would say this:
```
    (PutLink (EvaluationLink (PredicateNode "$timstamp") (VariableNode "$ts"))
       (CurrentTimeNode "now"))
```
* Create RandomNode for a uniform distribution 0 to 1 which
  can be used to evaluate to true/false by using GreaterThanLink
  or alternately -- and all-in-one predicate for this.
