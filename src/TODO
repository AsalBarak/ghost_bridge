hack on D Dmaris -- btree branch

* listen to tts_en ros message for string and input to OC chat

-- btree makes chatbot not talk if it knows the answer.

-- behaviors:

do NOT change expression while chatbot is talking
use the lipsync topic  ?  no ...
/eva/speech_events   start stop   string


if she hears: look at me: change who she is looking at.

if chatbot has not heard anything for a minute then say something
(but only if people are visible.)
say something like "why are you ignoring me?"
set aiml topic to bored, and thell aiml to say something.
no -- sent a special sentence to chatbot, which responds.

topic is /chatbot_speech 

action orchestrator -- listen to topic and block expressions/gestures
if pupeteering ... but its easier to cut off at python EvaControl level.
Vytas will do that.

sent to chatbot : xyzzy message of what happened.


listen to a sequence of behaviors and run them, but only if no other 
stuff is coming



send a start , stop and resume pervromance message to some ros topic.
the timeline performer will do the performance.
