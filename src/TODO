* in order for OC to hear, it should listen to tts_en ros message
  for NL text string, and pass it on to process_query.

-- btree makes chatbot not talk if it knows the answer.
   silence chatbot by saying no affect publish
   Huh? I guess chatbost doesn't talk if no affect is published?
	That's right, but its short-circuited right now.

-- behaviors:


 * if she hears: "look at me": change who she is looking at.

if chatbot has not heard anything for a minute then say something
(but only if people are visible.)
say something like "why are you ignoring me?"
set aiml topic to bored, and tell aiml to say something.
no -- sent a special sentence to chatbot, which responds.

* For chatbot, use something other than proces-query

listen to a sequence of behaviors and run them, but only if no other
stuff is coming

Revert to normal behaviors when done conversing.

----

New bugs:
---------
* When listening, there are no defined behaviors... See
  (DefinedPredicate "Speech listening?")

* If she thinks she is talking, but the room clears out, then
  what?  Is it guaranteed that vocalizatino will stop after a while,
  or should she force-reset?  .. Probably should force reset, to
  pick up those animations?

* Kino requests: send to chatbot : xyzzy message of what happened.
  Clarify ... cause you can subscribe to ROS messages for emotions,
  and for /camera/face_event yourself...

* What's the topic for hearing?
