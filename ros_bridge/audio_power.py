'''
    This implements a ROS node that subscribes to the `audio_sensors`
    topic, and passes the audio power data to the cogserver. This is
    used by OpenCog to react to loud sounds, sudden changes, and
    general background noise levels.

    An enhancement would be a a neural net that responded to clapping,
    cheering, or other common sound events, identified them, labelled
    them, and passed them on into the atomspace.
